# SortingAlgoGraph

## Information
This is a simple project written exclusively in Java utilizing the [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) library to show how famous sorting algorithms are performing when the amount of items is gradually increasing. The algorithms being tested are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Select Sort, Heap Sort and Quick Sort.

## Executable
If you want to jump straight into running the program, the .jar executable is available under the `Releases` section. You can run it like this: `java -jar SortingAlgoGraph.jar`

## Credits
The official **unmodified** versions of the algorithms were created by Dr. Alexander Astaras (Bubble, Selection, Insertion) and Adohe (Heap Sort). The versions presented in this project were modified to fit the purpose of the project.
